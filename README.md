# EMAAR | AI + Concierge Hiring

A tiny Streamlit prototype that blends AI-style screening efficiency with a hospitality-grade “concierge” candidate experience. 
Built for an IHRM presentation: ethical, explainable, and human-in-the-loop by design.

## What it shows
- Recruiter View: paste a JD, set weighted criteria, upload a resume, get an explainable fit score, auto-generate a concierge call script, and review an Ethics & Audit checklist.
- Candidate View: upload a resume, pick a concierge call slot, and receive a warm confirmation.

## Run locally
1) Create a virtual environment
